hello there modder!!!
I will try to keep this short and simple!
that is how i want it to be anyway.
first things first:

# mod api
this mod api is simple and should support c# programming.
it should allow the following:
* code injection
* model injection
* soundtrack/audio injection<br>
-(bepinex is a unity injector)-<br>
speaking of bepinex

# bepinex
bepinex should be under
```
./Fallow/bepinex/plugins
```
that is where mods go.<br>
all mods should fall under there wether it be:<br>
* code mods (just change mechanics)
* model mods
* sound mods
# texture packs
texture packs fall under <br>
```
./Fallow/textures
```
these will fall under (filename).zip<br>
not:
* rar
* 7z
* or any other filetype
# settings
settings should fall under<br>
```
./Fallow/configs/settingsconfigs/settings.config
```
these can also be found in game<br>
(remember these will generate on first launch so PLEASE launch the game to <br>
 main menu atleast once!)<br>
