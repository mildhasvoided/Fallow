# Fallow Documentation
hello there modder!!!
I will try to keep this short and simple!
that is how i want it to be anyway.
first things first:

# mod api
this mod api is simple and should support c# programming.
it should allow the following:
* code injection
* model injection
* soundtrack/audio injection<br>
-(bepinex is a unity injector)-
speaking on bepinex

# bepinex
bepinex should be under
```
./Fallow/bepinex/plugins
```
that is where mods go
