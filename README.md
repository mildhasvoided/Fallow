# Fallow
A unity game 6000.2.6f2

Open source!
but only for making mods and plugins (do not fork the game)
all assets and textures will be available but do not *"steal"* them







* i would only consider it stealing if you use the asset (and pretend its yours) other than that, the asset can be used in mods,plugins.
